this is a bare bones example of how to run express as an api server and router
and also run react as a front end page renderer (and router)

both parts need their own server running. cd into the build and root directories
and run
"npm start"

one will run (React) on port 3000 and the other (express) on 5000

they really are two different servers on two different ports. I think that in
a production environment  the web server would be on the standard port, but I'm
unsure what the api server would be on. can they both be on the same port?

the react app calls the list api call, but I'm unsure how the servers know which
one of them is being called because the url is just 'api/getList'
