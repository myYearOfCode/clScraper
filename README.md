# clScraper
A node-based scraper with a react front end to practice server side scraping with jquery/cheerio.

This is a simple project designed to grab some results from craigslist and then display them in a slightly different way. 
It's really an exercise in passing data between the front end and the back end. The scraper part is in node, express, and cheerio. The front end is in react.
