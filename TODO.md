***TODO***

figure out how to pass data from api to front end via json.

get react routing set up

maybe do full express setup?
 i dont know.

work on hidden database, even if it is just in localstorage.

scrape all h4's in the first colmask
scrape all ul's in the first colmask
{h4.innerText: ul.innerText}
hopefully the ul text will come across cleanly.
